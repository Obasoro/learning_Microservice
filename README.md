`node --version`
`npm --version`

You are now ready to create a stub Node.js project
`npm init -y`

Installing expressjs
`npm install --save express`

Note that --save isn’t actually necessary anymore. In older versions of Node.js, this
was required; these days, it’s the default. I’ve included --save explicitly so that I can
highlight what it does, but you don’t actually have to use this anymore.

Installing npm

`npm install`
